## Content Additional Information

Feel free to add any additional write-up, documentation, installation help, 
etc. to this document. It's a regular 
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) document, and will be
formatted and rendered as HTML, along with the game type metadata from the
accompanying YAML file.

## Next Steps

A template `managed.yml` file has been generated, you can populate it with all
the relevant information.

### Graphics

To use a custom title graphic, place a 1024 x 300 aspect ratio image in any 
format in the content directory and set the `titleImage` option in 
`managed.yml` to the image file name.

### Releases and Files

Content may have multiple associated downloads for different versions or
platforms. These are best added via the `managed add` command line and
associated arguments.
